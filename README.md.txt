# SketchSwitcher
This repository holds the code to switch between **Processing executable** sketches. Two main methods will open/close an excutable through a **batch** file.

### Setup
- Introduce the folder of the exported sketch/es into the SketchSwitcher folder.
- Check the name of the folder and the executable inside are the same.
- Implement a method to switch between sketches using the variable currentSketch and the methods openSketch() and closeSketch(). I.e. timer, UDP, keyPressed...

> Alert! When exporting the sketch make sure all the files are inside the data folder.
